            <h1>Who is Hush Hush?</h1>
            <p>Hush Hush Mechanic was founded in April 2020, shortly after the pandemic has started.</p>
            <p>The idea was to allow everyone have access to bike detailling, so that when you hop on your bike, you know every part is going to work smoothly and feels brand new every ride. (And to eliminate all the creaks and squeaks on your bike so I don't have to suffer when riding next to you!)</p>
            <p>As time went on, our range of service also increased to cater to different needs. From basic bike detailling, to full bike strip and rebuild,l or bespoke services such as installing bike wraps and wheel builds, Hush Hush is here to help.</p>
            <p>Hush Hush differentiates itself from conventional bike shops by the fact that we don't have profit margins. We sell our service and commitment to perfection. Not products.</p>
            <p>If Hush Hush recommends anything to you, rest assured it's for the pleasure of you riding a well maintained machine rather than having all the bells and whistles.</p>
            <p>We hope to continuously provide you excellent service in the future, and always be the one who's - Quietly Brilliant</p>
            <br />
            <p>Kusson- Founder</p>
